## Uses the following models

1. Logitstic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Random Forest (RF)
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
6. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)

## Other important aspects
* Imputation of Missing Values by Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)
* Hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization and 5-Fold Stratified Crossvalidation
* Adressing Class Imbalance with Hybrid Method Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique with Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTE-ENN)
* Evaluation using Precision Recall Area under Curve (PRAUC) and Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUROC)
* Model Comparison using 5x2 cv combined F-test
